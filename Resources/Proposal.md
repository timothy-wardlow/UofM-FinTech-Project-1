## Team Members

* If you were looking at a portfolio of crypto versus standard portfolio currently, what are some of the metrics you would be interested in as far as risk tolerence looking back at the dotcom crash
* Create a Monte Carlo simulation of the Nasdaq during the dotcom boom timeframe and how does that relate to what actually happened.
