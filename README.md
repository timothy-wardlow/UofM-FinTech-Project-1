## Can we predict the trajectory of Bitcoin based on historical data of the Nasdaq Market Cap, US GDP and World GDP? 
## Comparing the Nasdaq Market Cap from 1995-2005 to Bitcoin from 2014-2021, what metrics would be of interest as far as risk tolerance? How do the two compare? 
## If we create a Monte Carlo Simulation based on data from the Nasdaq Composite during the dotcom era, how does it compare to what actually happened? Can we justify using the same simulation to predict the trajectory of Bitcoin? 

### Comparing risk factors of the Nasdaq Composite from 1995-2005 versus Bitcoin from 2014-2021
#### We calculated annualized standard deviation and sharpe ratio as risk metrics
#### Given more accessiblilty to data (free data proved to be useful but did not encapsulate everything we needed) and time to work on the project, we would have looked at calculating beta as a risk metric. 
### Predicting the trajectory of Bitcoin based on historical data of the Nasdaq Market Cap, US GDP and World GDP
#### We were unable to explore this topic as accessible (free) data for the Market Cap of the Nasdaq was unavailable at the time.
### Using Monte Carlo as a predictor
#### The model built was crude and broke down long term. Incorporating time series, exponential averages and drift could make the model more reliable.


### Is Bitcoin in a pre or post bust based on the analysis? 
#### We were unable to come up with a definitve answer to the question we posed for the project due to limited open source data and time. Our hypothesis, based on the comparisons we were able to make between the Nasdaq Composite during the dotcom era 1995-2005 and Bitcoin from 2014-2021, was that Bitcoin was possibly leading up to a bust.
